## End to End Machine Learning Project
🎓 Predicting Student Performance Using Machine Learning 📊

🌟 Project Overview:
Predicted students' subject scores (math, reading, and writing) based on various factors, such as gender, race/ethnicity, parental education, lunch type, and test preparation status. By leveraging data analytics and machine learning, it is explored how socio-demographic factors influence academic outcomes.

📈 What has been done:
1. Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and trends in the data.
2. Applied feature engineering to enhance the dataset for better model performance.
3. Built and evaluated several machine learning models, including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests.
4. Analyzed results to identify key factors influencing student performance and achieved high prediction accuracy with meaningful insights.

🔍 Key Insights:
1. Test preparation courses had a significant positive impact on scores across all subjects.
2. Students with access to standard lunches tended to perform better.
3. Parental education level showed a strong correlation with higher academic performance.

💻 Technical Skills Used:
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn), Data Preprocessing, Feature Engineering, Regression Models, and Visualization.

🎯 Takeaway:
This project showcases how data-driven approaches can provide actionable insights into improving educational outcomes. Machine learning, when applied thoughtfully, holds immense potential to shape data-informed decisions in education.
